        world.<br>I am eagar to learn everything I can about the world of computers, from the basis of making hardware to the complex
        way of making software.<br>I'm particularly interested in artificial security, software security, hardware security, and I can't
        wait to explore these areas in my studies.<br>While I'm still in the early stages of my academic journey, I'm already
